<ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>All the entries are counted and checked for correct file formatting and errors</li>
<li>All entries are then randomly sorted into brackets</li>
<li>Each week a bracket will be released to the public</li>
<li>At the end of each week the results from the judges will be released.</li>

<tr><td colspan="2">Numbers judges will be working with:</td></tr>

<p>* If you do not have 80% at this point, regardless of extras you will not qualify.<br><br>
If on the off shot someone gets 100pts from the judges before extras, they get an automatic bi to the final round.</p>

 
<p><b>Round 2:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>The remaining entries are bracketed again to adjust for Round 1</li>
<li>This time judges and the public will have direct say in what moves on
	<ul><li>For each bracket the public rank their Top 10</li>
	<li>For each bracket the judges rank their Top 10</li></ul>
</li>
<li>For both the judges and the public, from their list of 10, we are taking the TOP 3<br><br>
The judge picks take priority, so if the public picks any entry that is already selected by the judges, 
the entry directly below gets moved up.</li>
<li>Six (6) total entries per bracket will move on.</li>
</ul></p>

 
<p><b>Round 3: (Final)</b>
<ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>The remaining 6 entries (per bracket) are bracketed into final sets</li>
<li>The judges pick their top 4</li>
<li>The public picks their top 4</li></ul>
</p>

<p>There will be a Top 3 from the public and official judges this TournaMix, much to the success of TM3. The Top 3 and runner 
up for both the judges and public will be posted. If the same file wins from the judges and public, consider yourself the best 
stepper of the contest!</p>

<p>This will also conclude Tournamix. We’ve had a good run and a lot of fun over the years. The current style of rules and 
theme simulator are all out of date and instead of butchering the contest to update it, we’re going to revamp. A lot needs to 
be updated to include SM and ITG as well as other aspects that interest people. Our team looks forward to the next time everyone 
can enjoy a contest from us.</p>
