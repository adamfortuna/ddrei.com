<p>This TournaMix will run on an actual point system. In order to make it through the first round brackets you need to finish with 80pts. There will be three (3) official categories the judges will be working from. This is where you will get the bulk of your points.  However, if you continue to read down, you will see there are a few other ways to earn points if you lose some in the bulk zone.  OH! By the way! There are also ways to lose points too! (Penalties)</p>
<br><br>

<b>STEP FILE:</b>
<p>You will be judged officially on your light, standard and heavy steps. Each will get its own grade with the total (L+S+H) being your final score. This is a complete step file contest and we’re going to have incentive this time to do well in the other areas. Don’t neglect your Light or Standard steps. It will affect your overall grade!</p>
<p>The judges will look for a good balance for introductory and advanced steps going from Light to Standard and finally to Heavy.  Also, make sure that your foot rating is appropriate.  For example, putting down a 3 feet rating for Cartoon Heroes (Heavy) is NOT appropriate. We want difficulty levels that gauge how well you do to those who are just getting to those levels, so bad foot ratings will be spotted out on that basis.</p>
<p>This TM, song choice will continue to count towards your grade. As much as this is a step file contest, it’s as much about picking the right song… or I should say picking the best song to the steps you make.  Like it or not, chances are, you take the song into account much more than you realize. However, this time song choice is integrated into the over all Step File Grade to avoid double grading.</p>

<b>DESIGN:</b>
<p>Please understand that we don’t expect your work to be sloppy. If you want to have a sloppy folder with half folder names, that’s fine with us.  However, intentional sloppiness will not be tolerated in TournaMix.</p>
<p>Make sure your entry package has congruent names, labels, and file formats. A percent of your formatting points will come from your README. Please understand we’re trying to be professional about this. If you are entering a file into a contest, you should be able to speak about, explain and justify your entry to the judges. We feel this is important.</p>

<b>ENTRY EXTRAS:</b>
<p>Remember the section about earning extra points towards your final score? Well here it is.  The concept behind this one being that if you’re willing to spend the extra time to increase your entries potential over all appearance, you should be compensated for such.</p>
<p>The amount is very small, a total of 5pts regardless of how many you do. Please don’t limit yourself to just doing a few. Try and shoot for all of them if possible.</p>
<p>Please note: Just because you do one of these for extra points doesn’t mean you will instantly get them! These are rewards and even if you do one, if we feel it doesn’t fit, or done extremely poorly, we may not award the points.</p>
