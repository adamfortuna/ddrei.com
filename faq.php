		<p><b>How do I play DDR, or another music game, on my computer?</b><br>
			There are a number of different simulators that let you play ddr on your computer.  You can buy pads (usually serial port pads) and use those, or just use a keyboard/controller.  The <a href=http://www.ddrei.com/links.php?cat=17>simulators</a> section of 'links' has a few places to download the programs themselves.
		</p>
		<p><b>Where can I download the simulator files (steps, backgrounds, songs)?</b><br>
			In the <a href=http://ddrei.com/media.php>info</a> there is a folder containing all DWI files on the site (the only simulator files we currently have.
		</p>
		<p><b>Can I play DDR for anything other than computer?</b><br>
			Playstation (1) is the best system for playing DDR aside from computer. Check out the <a href=http://ddrei.com/store.php>store</a> section for a few places to buy the games for playstation.
		</p>
		<p><b>Where can I buy pads to play DDR?</b><br>
			RedOctane is the number one source for DDR in the US.  For a list of pads for sale there, check out the <a href=http://www.ddrei.com/pads.php>DDR Pads</a> section.
		</p>
		<p><b>Where can I download videos?</b><br>
			The <a href=http://www.ddrei.com/pafiledb.php>DDRei media section</a> has videos from a number of DDR tournaments in the east, but is still growing.  Other sites with videos include <a href=http://ddrfreak.com>DDR Freak</a> and <a href=http://bemanix.com>Bemanix</a>.
		</p>
		<p><b>Why aren't some of the videos working?</b><br>
			Most the videos on this site use Divx 4.x codec to compress the videos. To install Divx, go to <a href=http://divx.com>Divx.com</a> and download the latest codec - it will work on all previous versions of Divx.
		</p>
		<p><b>What are the .ace files for the DWI's?</b><br>
			These files are compressed using WinAce.  To uncompress them, I suggest getting <a href=http://www.winrar.com>WinRar</a>.
		</p>
		<p><b>When I download files from the media section the files are only about 4k.. whats the problem?</b><br>
			This error means that either you have too many connections to the site (generally 2) or that the server is full (probably the first one).  If you are not downloading anything and get this error, try closing your broswer and reopening DDRei.
		</p>
		<p><b>I can't find [something] on this site.. where is it?</b><br>
			If you can't find something, check the <a href=http://www.ddrei.com/help.php>site map</a>.  If you can't find it there, try the search function on the right.

			Sure!  Anything is appreciated and credit is always given in fullest.  Reviews can be added in the reviews section, news may be submited to the main page.  Anything else just email Dyogenez.
		</p>
		<p><b>What does [something] mean?</b><br>
			If it's a common term, we'll try to put it in the <a href=http://www.ddrei.com/dictionary.php>Dictionary</a>.  If it's not there, feel free to ask in the <a href=http://forums.ddrei.com>Forums</a>.
