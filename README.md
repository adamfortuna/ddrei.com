# DDRei.com

Freshman year of college, back in 2000, I got really into playing Dance Dance Revolution. Unfortunately all the DDR websites and community were out west, while I lived in Orlando. I decided to create a website and community for East Cost DDR.

The code for this site is completely awful. I had no concept of object oriented programming, MVC, DRY or any concept of a programming framework. Feel free to point and laugh (and comment) on how awful any part of this is.
